/**
One thing you'll notice about writing CSS is that a lot of it is about boxes:
setting their size, color, position, etc. Most of the HTML elements on your page
can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of each other.

Not surprisingly, CSS layout is based principally on the box model. Each of the
blocks taking up space on your page has properties like this:

* padding, the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text)
* border, the solid line that sits just outside the padding
* margin, the space around the outside of the element
* width (of an element)
* height (of an element)


**/

/**
We'll play around with more CSS to get a better understanding of the difference
between margin, border, padding, and width/height. Check out the CSS below.
**/


/** UNCOMMENT ME
html {
    background-color: #00539F;
}

body {
    width: 600px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #FF9500;
    padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
    border: 5px solid black;
}
UNCOMMENT ME **/


/**

Now for the body element. There are quite a few declarations here, so let's go
through them all one by one:

* width: 600px; — this forces the body to always be 600 pixels wide.
* margin: 0 auto; — When you set two values on a property like margin or
          padding, the first value affects the element's top and bottom side
          (make it 0 in this case), and the second value the left and right side
          (here, auto is a special value that divides the available horizontal
          space evenly between left and right). You can also use one, three, or
          four values, as documented here.
* background-color: #FF9500; — as before, this sets the element's background
                    color. I used a sort of reddish orange for the body as
                    opposed to dark blue for the html element. Go ahead and
                    experiment. Feel free to use white or whatever you like.
* padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; — we have four values set on the padding, to make a
           bit of space around our content. This time we are setting no padding
           on the top of the body, and 20 pixels on the left, bottom and right.
           The values set top, right, bottom, left, in that order.
* border: 5px solid black; — this simply sets a 5 pixel wide solid black border
          on all sides of the body.

/** UNCOMMENT ME
h1 {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px 0;
    color: #00539F;
}
UNCOMMENT ME **/


/**
You may have noticed there's a horrible gap at the top of the body. That happens
because browsers apply some default styling to the <h1> element (among others),
even when you haven't applied any CSS at all! That might sound like a bad idea,
but we want even an unstyled webpage to have basic readability. To get rid of
the gap we overrode the default styling by setting margin: 0;.

Next up, we've set the heading's top and bottom padding to 20 pixels, and made
the heading text the same color as the html background color.

Again, try experimenting with different values to see what you can come up with.

/** UNCOMMENT ME
img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
UNCOMMENT ME **/

/**
Finally, we'll center the image to make it look better. We could use the
margin: 0 auto trick again as we did earlier for the body, but we also need to
do something else. The body element is block level, meaning it takes up space on
the page and can have margin and other spacing values applied to it. Images, on
the other hand, are inline elements, meaning they can't. So to apply margins to
the image, we have to give the image block-level behavior using display: block;.

This is the end of our HTML+CSS workshop! You've learned quite a bit about both
HTML and CSS, how they work together, and how to make some cool pages from
scratch. There's a lot more to learn, though. To find out more, check out these
